Configuration management is a great way of investing into the longevity of your projects. Though none of my projects have yet to require any type of configuration management, I can imagine medium to large size software systems requiring it. Imagine having to rebuild an entire system every time you wanted to add another feature. Productivity would halt because you would constantly be going back to square one. My only experience with configuration management was in my C programming class where we used version control for our project. One version was the project in C and the other version was it in C++. With some systems becoming so large, having a strong sense of configuration management allows you to work smart. Making something again from scratch requires more time and effort than maintaining and updating an existing system.


While git is a popular configuration management, GitHub is more popular. Git is to videos as GitHub is to YouTube. GitHub makes it so easy to upload your source code, have you and others tweak it, then commit better iterations of it. The open source community contributes to Github being more popular than git. I would bet that most people found GitHub first, then used git to make uploading to GitHub easier. I’ve recently delved in the world of GitHub and I’ve yet to scratch the surface of git. I think GitHub is less intimidating because of its accessibility and low learning curve, whereas git is for someone who’s experienced with GitHub and wants to integrate their command line more.
