# Meteor Got Me Like it Got the Dinosaurs

Meteor is like medicine or a habit that is such a pain to deal with. I sometimes stop myself and say, "All this time is spent making meteor, and not doing any REAL work." It was like that for quite some time. I think it mainly had to with problems stemming in the first part of first digits application experience. For some reason, my .gitignore file was smiply not in my development folder, this created some problems. One of them was the fact that I had to commit 3000 files to Github. That shouldn't be happening. After many iterations of the first part of the digits experience. I got it somewhat working. Specifically on linux Ubuntu, the .gitignore file is invisible to the file manager gui to my inconvenience. I'm still figuring out a way to do it perfectly. One way is to bite the bullet and learn it command line style and other way is to find a clever way to clone the digits repo then clone the application repo to my local computer's digits folder. 

The process of making the digits app is not the problem, it's getting to the part where I actually develop digits that's the problem. Another problem that I fixed (I hope) was ESlint being weird. In all other experiences, ESlint made no complaints, but now, I have to manually look for the ESlint file that's local to the project. Many iterations of digits1 were left in the dust without the guidance of ESlint. Thankfully, I was able to fix that, because I will be needing it. 


Going through the first three digits experience with the video are problem free, the only problem is being able to  figure out mistakes on the fly without referencing the video. If you follow the video step by step, there are no mistakes, but that's not learning. What if I skip an import, am I able to troubleshoot and come up with a solution? This is important because there won't be a video telling me how to do my development step by step in the real world.
