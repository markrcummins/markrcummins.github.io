Technical questions exist on another world, far from the open ended philosophical questions about relationships, life, and happiness. People happily spend their time writing a response to your question that might provide you insight, or simply for the sake of writing and writing their interpretation of it is. Technical forum contributors don’t do this. Technical questions are not philosophical, aren’t open to interpretation, and require an unambiguous answer. Contributors of a technical forum have expertise in that field, explaining the how and why and leading smart questions with a solution.
