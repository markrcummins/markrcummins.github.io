ICS Book Market is a group project started in my software engineering course, ICS 314. After learning the basics of HTML, CSS, and Javascript, we were assigned to create a web application built on the Meteor framework. 

Our idea was simple, make an application that allows ICS students to buy and sell textbooks with each other. We wanted an app that was appealing by design and intuitive so we decided to use Semantic UI. To make the app exclusive to UH students only, we utilized the CAS login system where a valid hawaii.edu account is required to sign in. 

My contribution to the project was creating the pages that allowed a user to post their book up for sale using a schema that held values like price and condition of the book. I also implemented the books for sale having an icon that allowed you to directly email the seller. 

Unfortunately, the application is not fully functional yet, but we do plan to continue working on it. Here's the <a href="https://icsbookmarket.github.io/">Github page</a> documenting the development of the project.
