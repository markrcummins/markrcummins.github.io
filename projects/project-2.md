For ICS 451, each group had to research a modern networking topic and write a paper to help teach someone the technical aspects of your topic.

My research into Tor opened me into the field of network anonymity. The thing about anonymity is that it's not about the technical aspect that's important, it's also the philosophical idea of having the right to privacy from your neighbors, strangers, and government. 

Learning about the Tor project introduced me to a variety of tools made to keep your identity hidden as well as the tools used to expose it. After learning about the non-profit organization that develops Tor and the open source community that helps, I'm very intrested in learning more C and the details of networking so that I can contribute to the Tor project one day.
