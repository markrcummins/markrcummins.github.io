For ICS 451, each group had to research a modern networking topic and write a paper in a way that someone who has never heard of your topic can learn it from your paper.

My research into Tor opened me into the entire field of anonymity. The thing about anonymity is that it's not about the technical aspect that's important, it's also the philosophical idea of having the right to privacy from your neighbors, strangers, and the government. 

Learning about the Tor project introduced me to a variety of tools made to keep your identity hidden as well as the tools used to expose it. After learning about the non-profit organization that updates Tor and the open source community that helps, I'm very intrested in learning more C and the details of networking so that I can contribute to the Tor project.
